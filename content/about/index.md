# Master NoName

He has no name.

He was a talented young kid when selected as a basketball shooting team member. He shot a 4/10 at the selection, then he got enrolled as a young shooter and began his wonderful basketball shooting life.

He was not so good at the beginning, not so stable. His average score is 4/10, which is the lowest criteria in the team. But he shot 3/10 for two times, according to the team rule, one who shot lower than 4/10 should be punished, if he is lower for two times, he will got the final chance to shot a 4/10, if he failed for that,  dismissed. At that time, he was almost kicked out. He practiced many times, finally he managed to get 4/10 and continue his game.

Soon after that, he started to make progress. He stabilized his score above 4 and he started to prepare to become the main shooter. Since the obstacles he had been through during the past many terms, he grew up fast and break the union record at a unimaginable level, 9/10! He became famous suddenly, a main shooter of course. While breaking records brings him good reputation , his performance stuck. Sometimes even got back to 3 or 4 over 10. He tried very hard, but he remains average after he broke the record for a long time.

He was recommended to play for the master nomination. Although his average is not good enough, given that he is the one who broke the record, he was nominated. However, he did a 5/10 in the game, failed to reach the 6/10 for master.  He was very upset, but he still kept going. He shot day and night, gradually stabilized his performance at over 5. After many terms, he finally got a second chance to play for the master. And this time he did it! His score is 7/10.

After become Master NoName, he got depressed again, once play a 4/10. 4 represent a minus in Master level, while 5 means nothing. He had to play another round at 6 or above. He played 2 time later, while remain at 5. Once he got another 5 or below, he will be depreciated as a normal shooter. But under the press, he finally managed to go back to 6/10. Not long after that, he even reached his own record at 9/10 again. Everybody so excited!!!

He later maintained at a level above 6 ever since, sometimes reached 7, he eventually retired because he felt himself tired and need to have a good rest and enjoy his later life.

That is Master NoName, a basketball shooting master that should never be  forgotten.
